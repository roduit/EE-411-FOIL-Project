## Abstract 


## Project structure
```

```
The folder *laboratories* contains all the laboratories of the course "EE-442: Wireless Receivers: Algorithms and Architectures". Some of the blocks used in the project come from these labs and are properly cited. *Project* folder contains the code and documentation of the proposed project about OFDM. In the *code* subfolders ofdm_main.m computes the solutions and ofdm_multipath.m can be used to generate simulation of a multipath environment.

## Contributors
This project has been done by Vincent Roduit and Fabio Palmisano as a mandatory part of the course "EE-411: Fundamentals of Inference and Learning" given at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne during the Fall semester of 2023.
